**The goals of HyperDataJS**

1. Make it easy to embedd metadata labels to JSON schemoids.
2. Make it easy manage the properties of labels.
3. Make it easy to connect those properties to a schema in the fashion of Schema.org, where a unique url points to a hierarchical structure (taxonomy) of conceptual definitions as a contract of expected communication.
